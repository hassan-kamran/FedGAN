Interpretation Guide:
- Membership Inference: AUC closer to 0.5 indicates better privacy (random guess)
- Model Inversion: Higher reconstruction loss indicates better privacy
- Differential Privacy: Lower effective epsilon indicates better privacy
- Reconstruction Error: Higher minimum distance indicates better privacy
